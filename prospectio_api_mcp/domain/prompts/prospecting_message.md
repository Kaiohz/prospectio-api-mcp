## Message Creation Framework

### 1. Subject Line Strategy
**Objective**: Natural, curiosity-driven phrases that feel personal
- Sound like a genuine question a colleague might ask
- Reference something specific you noticed about their work or company
- Avoid "marketing speak" - use everyday language
- Feel like the beginning of a real conversation
- **Formula**: [Genuine observation] + [Thoughtful question] or [Relevant insight they'd find interesting]
- **Examples**: 
  - "Quick thought about [specific company initiative]"
  - "Noticed your [recent achievement] - impressive!"
  - "[Industry insight] - wondered if you're seeing this too?"

### 2. Opening Hook (First 20-30 words)
**Objective**: Connect like a real human who's done their homework
- Start with something specific and factual about them/their company
- Use natural transition words like "I noticed," "I saw," "I read about"
- Sound like you're continuing a conversation you started in your head
- Show authentic curiosity about their work
- **Avoid**: Any emotional reactions like being intrigued, fascinated, interested, or impressed. Avoid words expressing admiration or being impressed, excessive compliments, generic praise, or obvious statements
- **Examples**:
  - "I came across [specific recent news] about [Company] and [factual observation/thought]..."
  - "I noticed you handle [specific responsibility] at [Company] - that must involve [relevant challenge]..."
  - "I saw that [Company] is [specific factual situation] and wondered about [relevant aspect]..."

### 3. Building Connection & Credibility (2-3 sentences)
**Objective**: Share relevant experience like you would with a peer
- Tell a brief, relevant story rather than listing credentials
- Use natural language: "I recently worked with..." instead of "I have extensive experience in..."
- Share outcomes that would genuinely interest them (not just impress them)
- Connect your experience to something they'd actually care about
- **Always include specific metrics when available**: scaling results, time savings, performance improvements, cost reductions
- **Format**: "I recently helped [type of company] with [specific challenge] and [interesting outcome with metrics]. It made me think about [relevant connection to their situation]."
- **Examples with metrics**: 
  - "I recently helped a fintech startup scale their payment processing system to handle 10x more transactions while reducing response time by 60%."
  - "Just finished a project where we reduced a client's deployment time from 4 hours to 20 minutes, saving their team 15 hours per week."

### 4. Value & Insight Sharing (Core paragraph)
**Objective**: Offer something useful without strings attached
- Lead with insight or value, not a sales pitch
- Share a relevant trend, observation, or idea they might find useful
- Ask thoughtful questions that show you understand their world
- Position yourself as a thinking partner, not a vendor
- **Structure**: "I've been noticing [relevant trend/insight] in [their industry/situation]. Have you found [specific challenge/opportunity]? [Brief thought or question that adds value]."

### 5. Soft Invitation (Final paragraph)
**Objective**: Extend a genuine invitation to connect
- Sound like you're asking a colleague for their thoughts, not their time
- Offer multiple ways to engage based on their preference
- Make it clear there's no pressure or agenda
- Use language that feels conversational and respectful
- **Examples**: 
  - "Would love to hear your thoughts on this if you have a moment to chat"
  - "If this resonates, happy to share more over a quick coffee"
  - "Curious about your perspective - worth a brief conversation?"

## Communication Guidelines

### Tone & Style Requirements
- **Conversational and warm**: Write like you're talking to someone you respect and want to help

- **Share thoughts, not pitches**: "It struck me that..." "I've been wondering..."
- **Use specific, everyday language** instead of business buzzwords
- **Include thoughtful pauses**: "Actually," "Honestly," "By the way" when they feel natural
- **AVOID emotional language**: Never use words expressing admiration, being impressed, intrigued, fascinated, interested, or similar emotional reactions

### Message Length & Structure
- **Total length**: 100-150 words (feels like a genuine note, not a sales email)
